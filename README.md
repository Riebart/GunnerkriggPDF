# Gunnerkrigg Court Downloader

A collection of scripts that will pull down, sort (into chapters), and then knit the comics into PDFs you can take with you on the go for reading.

## Dependencies

- wget
- GNU grep (for the `-P` option)
- Imagemagick

## Running it

```bash
bash download.sh
```

Wait for it to finish, about 5-10 minutes, and then you'll notice a bunch of nice PDFs in your working directory!
